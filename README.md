# New maps in the new medium: <br> Teaching web cartography for a distributed workforce

## Outline

### Introduction

* Rich Donohue and Matt Wilson teach geography and mapping at UK Geography
* Recently designed, built, and now instruct courses in a new program called New Maps Plus
* New Maps Plus: 
  * specifically focuses on web-based cartography and GIS using open source software
  * is applied and practical (with some more critical/historical elements)
  * curriculum focuses on:
    1. fundamental geospatial processing and data analysis tasks using QGIS, GDAL/OGR, Node.js (and other misc tools: Mapshaper, Simple Statistics)
    2. web design and development using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. offers an introduction to programming aimed at non-Computer Scientists/Engineers, often entirely new to coding
    3. applying traditional cartographic principles to web interfaces, drawing upon user-centered design, usability engineering UX/UI practices
* to date we've offered X courses over X terms, instructing X students, X who have graduated with a Graduate Certificate in Digital Mapping, and X more who are taking additional courses toward an eventual MS degree
* to quickly showcase some of the student work coming out of the program ...

  * example
* web mapping and the curriculum it's intended to support is technically demanding and challenging, particularly as students have little background in web design and coding
* beyond these challenging aspects, the courses are taught asynchronously and completely online to a geographically distributed student body
* Question: how are we able to do this?
* Answer: Among the string of various technologies, libraries, and tools instruction, Git and its integration with GitHub has been instrumental in our evolution and success.
* Overview: talk will cover the following topics and address the strategies and recommendations we've learned along the way, as well as some enduring challenges
  * Benefits for course development and management
  * Benefits for student learning gains
